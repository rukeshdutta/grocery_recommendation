# Grocery Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a simple grocery recommendation system implemented in Python. The system uses synthetic data to simulate customer transactions and employs similarity measures to recommend products based on customer purchase patterns.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic customer-product transaction data for testing the recommendation system.
- **Customer-Product Interaction Matrix**: Converts transaction data into a matrix to analyze customer purchasing behavior.
- **Product Similarity Computation**: Uses cosine similarity to determine how similar products are based on customer purchase history.
- **Product Recommendations**: Recommends similar products to a given product.

---

## File Structure
- **`synthetic_grocery_data.csv`**: A synthetic dataset of customer transactions generated by the script.
- **Data Generation Script**: Creates synthetic transaction data.
- **Recommendation System Script**: Processes data to generate product recommendations.

---

## How It Works
### Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data
The `generate_synthetic_data` function simulates transaction data for a specified number of customers and products. Each customer purchases a random number of products from the product catalog.

**Example Output**:
| CustomerID   | Product    |
|--------------|------------|
| Customer_1   | Product_3  |
| Customer_1   | Product_5  |
| Customer_2   | Product_1  |

The generated data is saved to `synthetic_grocery_data.csv`.

### Step 2: Create a Recommendation System
1. **Data Loading**:
   The synthetic data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Customer-Product Interaction Matrix**:
   Converts the transaction data into a matrix where rows represent customers, columns represent products, and the values indicate whether a customer purchased a product.
3. **Product Similarity**:
   Computes the similarity between products using cosine similarity on the interaction matrix.
4. **Recommendation**:
   Given a product, the system recommends the top N similar products based on their similarity scores.

## How to Run
1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   Run the `generate_synthetic_data` script to create a dataset of customer transactions.

2. **Recommendation System**:
   Run the recommendation script and provide the product name for which you want recommendations. For example:
   ```python
   product_to_recommend = "Product_1"
   recommendations = recommend_products(product_to_recommend, product_similarity_df)
   print(recommendations)
   ```

---

## Example
**Input**:
- Product: `Product_1`

**Output**:
The top 5 most similar products to `Product_1`.

```plaintext
Top recommendations for 'Product_1':
Product_3    0.84
Product_5    0.79
Product_7    0.75
Product_9    0.73
Product_4    0.71
```

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

---

## Customization
- Modify the number of customers, products, or purchases in the `generate_synthetic_data` function to create larger or smaller datasets.
- Adjust the similarity measure or add additional features for more sophisticated recommendations.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-world datasets for better validation.
- Extend the recommendation system to include customer preferences or seasonal trends.
- Use advanced algorithms such as collaborative filtering or deep learning for improved recommendations.
